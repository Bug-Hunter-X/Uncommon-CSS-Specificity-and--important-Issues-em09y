# Uncommon CSS Specificity and !important Issues
This repository demonstrates a common yet tricky problem in CSS: unexpected behavior arising from specificity conflicts and the overuse of `!important`.

The `bug.css` file contains CSS code that exhibits this problem. The `bugSolution.css` file provides a solution by restructuring the CSS and removing unnecessary uses of `!important`.

## Problem Description
The problem stems from the intricate nature of CSS specificity. When multiple styles target the same element, the browser uses a set of rules to determine which style takes precedence.  The `!important` declaration overrides all specificity rules, which can make debugging and maintaining the stylesheet significantly harder.

## Solution
The solution involves reorganizing selectors to leverage CSS specificity effectively. Removing the unnecessary `!important` declarations enhances maintainability and readability of the code.  A well-structured CSS with clear and logical selectors is usually sufficient to achieve desired styles without resorting to `!important`.
