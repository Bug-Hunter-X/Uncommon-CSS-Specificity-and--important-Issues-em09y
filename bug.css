The CSS specificity rules can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior, especially when dealing with complex stylesheets.  For example, if you have conflicting styles defined in different stylesheets or within the same stylesheet, the most specific selector will take precedence. This can be difficult to debug, as the browser doesn't always clearly indicate which selector is winning.  Another common issue is the use of !important, which overrides all other style rules. Overuse of !important can make your stylesheet hard to maintain and debug.
